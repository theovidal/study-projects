## 🌈 How they work

These scripts are various challenges our teacher gave us in order to discover Arduino programming using [mBot robots](https://www.makeblock.com/mbot). Challenges 2 and 3 are pretty simple; The level is risen with the challenge 5 and, in a near future, the final challenge.

This is not a sort of ellaborated code, as it's a beginner level : besides, I feel really comfortable writing all of that. Nevertheless, I wanted to post this on my GitHub profile and more precisely in this repository, as it's a full school project (and it brings free commits, that's so good for my graph 😁).

## 🔌 Hardware setup

You must have a [mBot robot](https://www.makeblock.com/mbot) at home, and at least two motors and a line follower connected to it if you want to try the fifth challenge.

## ⌨ Software setup

Get the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), open scripts inside and download them on the robot. It's as simple ! You can of course modify them at your convenience in order to match your wishes.
